	<h3>Virtual Production Editing Tools - VPET</h3>
	Over the last decades, the process of filmmaking has always been subject to constant virtualization, resulting in empty green screen stages that leave the entire on-set crew clueless as real props are often replaced with virtual elements in later stages of production. With the development of Virtual Production workflows, solutions have been introduced that enable the decision-makers to explore the virtually augmented reality. However, current environments are either proprietary or lack usability, particularly when applied by filmmakers without a specialized knowledge of computer graphics and 3D software. As part of the European Union funded project Dreamspace we have developed a holistic approach for collaborative tools that allow real-time on-set light, asset and animation editing via an intuitive interface. <p>

	The Virtual Production Editing Tool (VPET) is a tablet based onset editing application to works within a virtual production environment. It is designed to run on mobile and head mounted devices (HMD) allowing easy access to operators without dedicated training. It provides functionality to edit assets during a virtual shooting and synchronize changes with the film pipeline. VPET communicates through a network interface to main applications and other clients, allowing live editing of object, light and animation parameters. The development is open-source and particularly considers established (offline) film pipelines. <p>
	VPET is a development by <a href="http://research.animationsinstitut.de" target="_new">Filmakademie Baden-Wuerttemberg, Institute of Animation's R&amp;D Labs</a> in the scope of the EU funded projects Dreamspace (610005) and SAUCE (780470).
