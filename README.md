Description

We have developed a holistic approach for collaborative tools that allow realtime on-set light, asset and animation editing via an intuitive interface. VPET is a tablet based onset editing application to work within a virtual production environment. The development is open-source and particularly considers established (offline) film pipelines.

VPET is a development by Filmakademie Baden-Wuerttemberg, Institute of Animation's R&D Labs in the scope of the EU funded Project Dreamspace (610005).
